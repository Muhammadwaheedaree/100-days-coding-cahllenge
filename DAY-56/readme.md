# 100 Days of TypeScript - Day 56

## Overview
On Day 56 of my 100 Days of TypeScript challenge, I focused on learning about JavaScript type conversion and basic math operators. This knowledge is essential for performing various operations and manipulating data types in JavaScript.

## Topics Covered

### Type Conversion
JavaScript type conversion involves converting one data type to another. Common type conversions include:

1. **String Conversion**: Converting a value to a string.
2. **Numeric Conversion**: Converting a value to a number.
3. **Boolean Conversion**: Converting a value to a boolean.

#### Key Points
- String conversion is used to transform values into string format.
- Numeric conversion allows values to be used in mathematical operations.
- Boolean conversion is useful for evaluating truthy and falsy values.

### Basic Math Operators
JavaScript provides several basic math operators to perform arithmetic operations:

1. **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two numbers.
2. **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts one number from another.
3. **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two numbers.
4. **Division (`/`)**: Divides one number by another.
5. **Remainder (`%`)**: Returns the remainder of a division operation.
6. **Exponentiation (`**`)**: Raises one number to the power of another.

#### Key Points
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are fundamental arithmetic operations.
- The remainder operator is used to find the remainder of a division.
- Exponentiation is used to raise a number to a specific power.
