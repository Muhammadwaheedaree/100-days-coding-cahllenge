## Day 76: Understanding DNS and DHCP

### What I Learned

Today’s focus was on **DNS (Domain Name System)** and **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**, two essential components of the internet. Here’s a brief overview of what these technologies do and how they work:

**DNS (Domain Name System):**  
DNS translates human-readable domain names (like `www.example.com`) into IP addresses (like `192.0.2.1`). Think of DNS as the internet’s phonebook, allowing browsers to locate websites by their domain names.

**DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):**  
DHCP assigns IP addresses to devices on a network automatically. This protocol simplifies network management by dynamically distributing IP addresses and other network configuration details.

### Key Concepts

- **DNS**: Translates domain names to IP addresses.
- **DHCP**: Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices.
