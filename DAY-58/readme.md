### Day 58: JavaScript Logical Operators and Nullish Coalescing Operator

#### Overview

On Day 58 of my 100 Days of Code Challenge, I explored JavaScript's logical operators and the nullish coalescing operator (`??`). These fundamental concepts are essential for building robust and efficient JavaScript applications.

#### Key Learnings

1. **Logical Operators:**
   - **AND (`&&`)**: Returns `true` if both operands are `true`. Used for combining multiple conditions.
   - **OR (`||`)**: Returns `true` if at least one operand is `true`. Useful for handling multiple alternative conditions.
   - **NOT (`!`)**: Inverts the truthiness of the operand. Helps in reversing conditions.

2. **Nullish Coalescing Operator (`??`):**
   - This operator returns the right-hand operand when the left-hand operand is `null` or `undefined`. It's particularly useful for providing default values.

#### Resource

For detailed information, refer to the article I studied:
- [JavaScript Logical Operators](https://javascript.info/logical-operators)
- [Nullish Coalescing Operator](https://javascript.info/nullish-coalescing-operator)

#### Summary

Understanding these operators is crucial for writing clean and effective code, especially when dealing with complex conditions and default values.
