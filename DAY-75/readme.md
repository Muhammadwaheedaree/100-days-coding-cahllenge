## Day 75 of #100DaysOfCode: How the Internet Works

### Overview
On Day 75 of my #100DaysOfCode journey, I delved into understanding how the Internet works. This knowledge is fundamental for any developer as it forms the backbone of web-based applications and services. Below is a summary of what I learned, along with key concepts and terms explained.

### Key Concepts and Learnings

#### What is the Internet?
The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate through a standardized set of protocols. It is decentralized, meaning no single person or organization controls it entirely.

#### Information Transfer: Wires, Cables, and Wi-Fi
Information on the Internet is transferred in the form of bits via various mediums:
- **Ethernet Cables**: Used for wired connections.
- **Fiber Optic Cables**: Utilize light to transfer data at high speeds over long distances.
- **Wireless Signals (Wi-Fi)**: Transfer data using radio waves.

#### IP Addresses and DNS
- **IP Addresses**: Unique numerical labels assigned to each device connected to a network.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other.

#### Packets, Routing, and Reliability
Data transferred over the Internet is broken down into smaller units called packets. These packets may take different routes to reach the destination, ensuring efficient and reliable data transfer.

#### HTTP and HTML
- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**: The protocol used for transferring web pages on the Internet.
- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: The standard language used to create and design web pages.

#### Encryption and Public Keys
Encryption ensures secure communication over the Internet. Key concepts include:
- **Cryptography**: The practice of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format.
- **SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security)**: Protocols for establishing a secure and encrypted link between a web server and a browser.

#### Cybersecurity and Crime
Cybersecurity involves protective measures to safeguard against cyber crimes, such as:
- **Phishing**: Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity.
- **Malware**: Malicious software designed to harm, exploit, or otherwise compromise the functioning of a computer system.

### Summary
Understanding the fundamental workings of the Internet provides a solid foundation for web development and enhances one's ability to troubleshoot, optimize, and secure applications.
