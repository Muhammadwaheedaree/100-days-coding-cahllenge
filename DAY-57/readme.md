### Day 57 of 100 Days of Code Challenge

Today's focus was on mastering JavaScript's `if-else` conditions and comparison operators. These are fundamental concepts that form the backbone of decision-making and logic in programming. Here's a glimpse of what I explored:

🔍 **If-Else Conditions**: I deepened my understanding of conditional statements, learning how to execute different blocks of code based on specified conditions. With `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements, I gained more control over the flow of my programs.

🔢 **Comparison Operators**: Understanding how to compare values in JavaScript is crucial for building robust applications. I delved into comparison operators such as `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=`, mastering the art of evaluating expressions and making informed decisions.
