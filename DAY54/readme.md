# JavaScript Basics Practice

This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge, focusing on core JavaScript concepts and script integration in HTML. The tasks were completed using Visual Studio Code and involved practicing both inline and external JavaScript scripting.

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Show an Alert (Inline Script)
Created an HTML page that displays an alert message using an inline script within the HTML file.

Moved the JavaScript code into an external file and linked it to the HTML file to display the alert.

## Tools Used
- *Visual Studio Code*: Used for writing and editing HTML and JavaScript code.
- *Android Studio*: Utilized for additional practice and testing on Android devices.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
3. Open the HTML file in your browser to see the alerts.

## Next Steps
- Continue exploring advanced JavaScript topics and modules.
- Implement best practices for JavaScript in both browser and Node.js environments.
