🌟 **Day 72 of #100DaysOfCode** 🌟

Today, I explored **Generics in TypeScript**! 🚀

Here's a quick summary of what I learned:

### 🛠️ Key Concepts:
- **Generics**: Allow you to create reusable and flexible code by passing types as parameters.
- **Code Reusability**: Write code once and use it with different types.
- **Type Safety**: Detect potential errors at compile time.
- **Handling Multiple Types**: Work with various data types without specifying a particular type.

### 🎯 Practical Applications:
- **Generic Functions**: Functions that work with any data type.
- **Generic Classes**: Classes that can operate on any data type.
- **Generic Interfaces**: Define contracts for classes that can use any data type.
- **Multiple Type Parameters**: Handle multiple types simultaneously for more flexibility.

### 📝 Example Usage:
- **Generic Function**: A function that returns the input value as is, regardless of its type.
- **Generic Class**: A class that can handle different types of items, such as books or games, while maintaining type safety.

Learning these concepts is crucial for building type-safe, reusable, and maintainable code in TypeScript.

Happy coding! 🚀
