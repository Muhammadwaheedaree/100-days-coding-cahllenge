**100 Days of Code: Day 59**

Today, I focused on understanding JavaScript loops and the `switch` statement. Here's a brief overview of what I learned:

### JavaScript Loops
1. **`while` Loop:**
   - Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

2. **`do...while` Loop:**
   - Similar to the `while` loop, but checks the condition after executing the block of code.

3. **`for` Loop:**
   - A more compact form of looping, allowing initialization, condition-checking, and increment/decrement in one line.

### The `switch` Statement
- Used for performing different actions based on different conditions.
- It is an alternative to using multiple `if...else if` statements, making the code cleaner and more readable for certain scenarios.
