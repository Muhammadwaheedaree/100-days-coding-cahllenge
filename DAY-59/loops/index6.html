        Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them to
        input again.

        The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the
        input/enters an empty line.

        Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special handling for a
        non-numeric input in this task.

        let num;
        do {
            num = prompt("Enter a number greater than 100?", 0);
        } while (num <= 100 && num);
