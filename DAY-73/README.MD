# Day 73: TypeScript Type Assertions

## Summary

Type assertions in TypeScript allow developers to inform the compiler of the expected type of a value, even when the type cannot be inferred. This is useful when dealing with dynamic data or integrating with non-TypeScript code.

### Example

```typescript
let data: any = 1000;

// Type assertion to treat "data" as a string
console.log((data as string).repeat(3));
```

### Explanation

1. **Variable Declaration**: `data` is assigned a value of `1000` with type `any`.
2. **Type Assertion**: We use `(data as string)` to assert `data` as a string.
3. **Method Usage**: The `repeat` method is called on `data`, treating it as a string, and repeats it three times.

### Note

Use type assertions cautiously to ensure the data matches the asserted type to avoid runtime errors.
